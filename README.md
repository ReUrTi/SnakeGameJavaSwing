# Snake Game

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic "Snake" game in Java using the Swing library. The player controls a snake that grows by eating fresh fruits while avoiding collisions with its own tail.

## Features

- Control the snake using the arrow keys.
- Various fruits with different effects:
  - Red fruit (R): increases score by 15 and adds a segment to the tail.
  - Yellow fruit (Y): increases score by 100 and adds a segment to the tail.
  - Black fruit (B): decreases score by 50.
- Score tracking and display of the current score.
- Ability to restart the game and return to the main menu.
- Dialogs for confirming exit from the game and returning to the main menu.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2. Clone the repository to your computer:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ReUrTi/SnakeGameJavaSwing.git

## Future

If I feel inclined in the future, or if any of you request it, I will attempt to implement settings and information, as well as add new features such as sound and images.
